# Encrypt your backup drive

MacOS will nicely encrypt any file system.  In order to do so,
* Open a view to the file system using the Mac Finder
* Right click on the file system
    * For example, you have inserted a thumb drive
    * Right click on the themb drive under Disks
* Select "Encrypt"
* Provide a passphrase

If the "disk" isn't formatted with a file system that supports encryption,
you can use the Disk Utility to reformat it as
MacOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)

Remember to save the passphrase in your password safe.
MacOS will offer to remember the passphrase in its keychain as well.
That is great!
