# Transmigration
## The soul of a new machine
These are utilities and instructions for putting a machine to death and
reincarnating it in another place.

I am currently using three devices built by Apple with Apple operating systems.
This focusses on transmigrating those devices.

The subtitle is a rip from a non-fiction book by Tracy Kidder, published by
Little, Brown and Company in 1981.
There is really no parallel between this and what the book is about.
The parallel stops at the title.
If you haven't
[read the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine)
and you're interested in computing technology and how it is made,
I recommend it to you.
The book won both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award.
It's a thrilling read.
