# Transmigration
## The soul of a machine
These are utilities and instructions for putting a machine to death and
reincarnating it in another place.
The instructions provide for you to be completely unable to resurrect
or produce **anything**
without assistance from people on the other side.

See [the transmigration web site](https://wbreeze.github.io/transmigration/) for the
set of documents about how to cross.

## Devices supported
I am currently using three devices built by Apple with Apple operating systems.
This focuses on transmigrating those devices.

If you would like to add instructions to do a similar thing with other
devices, see the contribution guidelines.

## Note about the subtitle
The subtitle is a rip from the title of a
[non-fiction book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine)
by Tracy Kidder,
published by Little, Brown and Company in 1981.
There is really no parallel between this and what the book is about.
The parallel stops at the title.

I recommend the book if you're interested in computing technology
and how it is (or was) made.

* It won both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1982.
* It's a thrilling read.

## Contribution guidelines
Your contributions are welcome.  This isn't something that most of us will
use everyday.  If you use it, and find that it needs updates, please post
an issue and, even better, fork and produce a pull request. 

Issues without pull requests might take forever to be addressed,
but they are still useful because they contain useful information for
others, who won't have to rediscover the problem.

If you do something like this with other devices, by all means please fork
and add your device specific version following the general outline
of the strategy given here.  Give us a pull request and we'll add it.
